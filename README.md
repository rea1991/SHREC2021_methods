# SHREC 2021: Retrieval and classification of protein surfaces equipped with physical and chemical properties

This repository is meant to make the dataset and ground truths introduced in [1] freely-accessible. For a complete description of both the benchmark and the methods that were tested on it, the reader is referred to [1].

### The dataset
A dataset of approximately 5,000 protein surfaces and corresponding physicochemical properties is provided. The dataset is already split into a training set (`dataset/training_set`) and a test set (`dataset/test_set`),  in the proportion 70%-30%. Each model is represented by an OFF file (i.e., a triangle mesh) and a TXT file: 
- Each row of the TXT file corresponds to a vertex of the triangulation in the corresponding OFF file (in the same order).
- Each column in the TXT file corresponds to a physicochemical property evaluated at the verteces in the OFF file. 

### The ground truths
The benchmark comes with three ground truths:
- The *PDB-based classification*, whose classification files are `ground_truths/classTraining.cla` for the training set and `ground_truths/classTest.cla` for the test set.
- The *BLAST-based decomposition of level 3*, whose classification vector for the test set is found in `ground_truths/macro_classes_GT2.txt`.
- The *BLAST-based community decomposition of level 2*, whose classification vector for the test set is found in `ground_truths/macro_classes_GT3.txt`.
